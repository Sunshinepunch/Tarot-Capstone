Tarot Terror (Absolutely a WIP name)

Project's Purpose or Goal: (This is a game that utilizes cards within a tarot deck to present randomized battles that serve as an opportunity for introspection while providing a fun gaming experience)

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

Provides a user the ability to pull and view randomized Tarot cards in a basic 3 card reading (past, present, future)
Takes the result of those cards to randomize a boss for the user to battle
Provides a pre-written piece based on the specific cards pulled to give the user something to meditate or think upon
What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

React - using a virtual DOM to display different Tarot cards based on the user's draw seems optimal
Tarot API (if it exists), or making one using the publicly available Rider-Waite deck images and descriptions
JavaScript to provide functionality for the backend game functionality
If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

The MVP will likely only use the 22 cards from the Major arcana (as adding the full 78 is...quite a feat.) Adding additional cards is an easy stretch goal. 
Using/Making a Tarot API might be a stretch goal instead, so if an API isn't ultimately utilized in the MVP, adding an API
Expanding length of game to include different more advanced readings, as a typical Tarot reading involves more than 3 cards
What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

Tarot API
Others involve additional coding or to be researched tools/frameworks/libraries - as it stands this project will likely be a JavaScript project utilizing React
